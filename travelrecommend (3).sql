(25, 1, 25, 9, 'Really very awesome place. It\'s a really wonderful place.  Especially at night the sea fun comes when the tide is very close or up.  Then it looks different to see the sea and different to see during the day.  He who does not see the sea at night will one day be able to enjoy the real beauty of the sea.  I was there for three days and went to see the sea at night for three days.  I had a lot of fun.  In fact, if I had not gone to Cox\'s Bazar to see the sea, I would not have enjoyed the beauty of the sea.  Went there on a holiday.  Many people gather, especially on holidays.  There are many markets around the sea.  The atmosphere here is very good and the beach is always clean and tidy.');
